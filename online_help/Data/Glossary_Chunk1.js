define({'test':{d:'One or more steps you define to verify a specific function or requirement of your application. You can create manual tests, or\nautomated tests that are executed by a testing tool. You organize your\ntests in a test plan tree, a hierarchical structure that divides your\napplication into testing units, or subjects. A test can contain multiple \ntest configurations.',l:''},'test configuration':{d:'A data set that describes a specific use-case of a test. For example, a test configuration can specify a subset of data. A test configuration is contained in a test instance.',l:''},'test coverage':{d:'The links you create to keep track of the relationship between your requirements and tests. In the Requirements module, you create test coverage by linking tests to a requirement. Test coverage assists you in assessing the impact of a change in the test or requirement. A requirement can be covered by more than one test, or by selected configurations of different tests.',l:''},'test criteria':{d:'When creating coverage between requirements and business process tests, instead of covering each requirement only at the level of a test, test criteria enables coverage by defined business components of a test.',l:''},'test instance':{d:'An occurrence of a test in a test set. Each test instance contains a defined test configuration.',l:''},'Test Lab module':{d:'Functional area of  accessible by selecting Test Lab on the  sidebar under Testing. This module enables you to create and manage \ntest sets, and perform test runs. You can schedule tests to run either \nmanually or automatically.',l:''},'Test Plan module':{d:'Functional area of ALM accessible by selecting Test Plan on the ALM sidebar under Testing. This module enables you to develop and \nmanage tests in a hierarchical tree-structure. Tests can be linked to\nrequirements and defects.',l:''},'test resource':{d:'Test resources are files or folders stored in the ALM repository that can be used by multiple tests. For example, a test resource can be a data file containing data needed as input for a number of tests.',l:''},'Test Resources module':{d:'Functional area of ALM accessible by selecting Test Resources on the ALM sidebar under Testing. This module enables you to manage test resources in a hierarchical tree-structure. Test resources can be associated with tests.',l:''},'test run':{d:'The execution of a test instance in a test set. You run tests in the Test Lab module. You can run tests manually or automatically, schedule the date and time of test runs, and set the conditions for when a test can be run. You can view results for a single test run, or view and compare details of all the runs for a selected test instance.',l:''},'Test Runs module':{d:'Functional area of ALM accessible by selecting Test Runs on the sidebar under Testing. This module enables you to view and analyze test run data for test runs, test set runs, and build verification suite runs (Lab Management only). You can also generate live execution reports.',l:''},'test set':{d:'A group of tests in an  project designed to achieve a specific testing goal, such as sanity or regression testing. Grouping the tests in your project into test sets helps you organize test execution to meet your testing goals. You can assign test set folders to cycles.',l:''},'test step':{d:'Detailed instructions on how to execute a test. Can include the action to perform on your application, the input to enter, or the expected outcome.',l:''},'test-level parameter':{d:'Variable values that a business process test or flow can receive and then pass to business components or flows for use as input values. See also: parameterization',l:''},'testing framework':{d:'A set of assumptions, concepts and tools that provide support for manual and automated software testing. The main advantage of such a framework is the low cost for maintenance. Business Process Testing is a component-based testing framework.',l:''},'testing host':{d:'A machine that runs a testing tool utilized by ALM to execute automated tests.',l:''},'Testing Hosts module':{d:'Functional area of ALM accessible by selecting Testing Hosts on the sidebar under Lab Resources. This module enables you to view the remote testing hosts in your project. You can also create and manage new private testing hosts.',l:''},'timeslot':{d:'A defined period of time in which the resources needed for running tests, or for performing maintenance tasks are reserved exclusively for the specified purpose.',l:''},'traceability matrix':{d:'Determines the extent of relationships between requirements and other requirements, and between requirements and tests.',l:''},'UFT':{d:'A comprehensive functional and regression testing tool. Unified Functional Testing (UFT) comprises the product formerly known as  QuickTest Professional and the product known as Service Test. Functionality provided by QuickTest is now known as GUI testing in UFT. Functionality provided by Service Test is also known as API testing in UFT.',l:''},'unused parameters':{d:'At the component level: A parameter is unused if it is not included in a component step.\nAt the test/flow level: A parameter is unused if it is not included in one of its component\u0027s steps and no component instances in the test/flow\u0027s test script tab contain the parameter.',l:''},'user-defined field (UDF)':{d:'Data fields that you can add to an ALM project. You can customize user-defined fields to meet the specific needs of your organization.',l:''},'version control':{d:'Tracks changes made to entities in your project, by maintaining previous versions of entities. In a version control enabled project, version history is maintained for entities, including requirements, tests, test resources, and business components. You can view and compare previous versions of an entity, or restore a previous version.',l:''},'Word add-in':{d:'You can import requirement or test plan data from a Microsoft Word document to an ALM project. To import from Word, you first install the ALM Microsoft Word Add-in on your client machine.',l:''},'workflow':{d:'A feature that offers tools to generate or edit scripts used to customize fields and values of the  modules, and to control the actions that users can perform. You can customize workflow from the Workflow page, available from the Project Customization window.',l:''}});
